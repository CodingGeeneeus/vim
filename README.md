Welcome to **LearnVim**, the perfect starting point for those new to Vim and feeling overwhelmed by the transition from graphical IDEs or text editors like VS Code to a terminal-based editor. LearnVim is designed to make your introduction to Vim as smooth and understandable as possible, emphasizing interactive learning with various keyboard layouts to demystify Vim's unique command and mode system.

## Why LearnVim?

LearnVim caters specifically to beginners by offering:

- **Keyboard Layout Flexibility:** Whether you're using ANSI, ISO*, Corne*, ZSA Moonlander*, ZSA Voyager, or Kinesis*, LearnVim lets you select your preferred keyboard layout. This way, you can learn Vim motions in an environment that mirrors your actual setup. Missing your layout? Request its addition by submitting an issue with the layout's name, a picture, and a brief description under the Keyboards label.

- **Mode-Specific Highlights:** LearnVim simplifies Vim by highlighting keys relevant to the mode you're in (Normal, Visual, Insert). This visual guide helps you understand which keys to use and when, easing the learning curve.

- **Comprehensive Command List:** Alongside interactive highlights, LearnVim provides a list of commands for each mode, acting as a quick reference to help you learn and practice Vim commands effectively.

## Coming Soon

We're constantly working to make LearnVim more inclusive of various keyboard layouts and configurations. The following are on our roadmap and will be supported soon:

- ISO Keyboard Layout
- Corne Keyboard Layout
- ZSA Moonlander Keyboard Layout

- Custom Key Configurations: Including popular configurations like ISRT, DVORAK, or fully customizable user setups.
